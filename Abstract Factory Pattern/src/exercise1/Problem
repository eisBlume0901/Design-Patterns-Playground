engines, and fuel for Toyota and Honda:

Abstract Factory Method Pattern Problem: Car Manufacturing System

You are tasked with designing an enhanced car manufacturing system using the Abstract
Factory Method pattern. The system should support the creation of different types of
cars from various brands, each sharing common car parts.

Requirements:


Define a CarParts interface with methods like assembleChassis, installEngine, and provideFuel.
Introduce specific types of chassis (ToyotaChassis, HondaChassis), engines (ToyotaEngine, HondaEngine),
and fuel systems (ToyotaFuelSystem, HondaFuelSystem).

Implement concrete classes (StandardCarParts, ToyotaChassis, HondaChassis, ToyotaEngine, HondaEngine,
ToyotaFuelSystem, HondaFuelSystem) that implement the CarParts interface, providing default and brand-specific
implementations for shared car parts assembly.

Create an abstract CarFactory interface with two factory methods: createCar and createCarParts.
createCar should return corresponding Car objects.
createCarParts should return an instance of the shared CarParts.

Implement concrete classes (ToyotaFactory and HondaFactory) that extend the CarFactory interface.
These classes should provide implementations for both factory methods, creating instances of ToyotaCar,
HondaCar, and the shared StandardCarParts.

Ensure that the client code uses the CarFactory interface and the factory methods to create instances of cars and
shared car parts without specifying their concrete classes.
