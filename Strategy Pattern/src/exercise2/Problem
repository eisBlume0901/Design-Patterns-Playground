Problem Inspiration: Design Puzzle Solution, Chapter 1, page 34 of Head First Design Patterns
You are designing a battle game that involves various character classes,
each with its unique attack strategy. The game features three character
classes: Knight, Archer, and Wizard. Your goal is to design a system that
allows these character classes to engage in battles using their distinct
attack strategies. Additionally, you want to ensure that new character
classes with different attack strategies can be added to the game without
modifying the existing code.

Character Classes and Attack Strategies:

Knight:

Attack Damage: 10 (for melee sword attacks)
Health Points (HP): 100
Archer:

Attack Damage: 8 (for ranged bow and arrow attacks)
Health Points (HP): 80
Wizard:

Attack Damage: 12 (for ranged magic spell attacks)
Health Points (HP): 90
