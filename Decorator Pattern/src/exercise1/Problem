You are designing a system for a pizza delivery service.
The service offers different types of pizzas like Margherita, Pepperoni, and Veggie.
Each type of pizza can have extra toppings like extra cheese, olives, chicken, and mushrooms.
The cost of each pizza varies and each extra topping also has an additional cost.

Pizza Base Prices:

Margherita: ₱300.00
Pepperoni: ₱350.00
Veggie: ₱325.00

Additional Ingredient Prices:

Extra Cheese: ₱50.00
Olives: ₱40.00
Chicken: ₱60.00
Mushrooms: ₱35.00

Your task is to design a system that can calculate the cost of any order. The system should be
flexible enough to easily add new types of pizzas or extra toppings in the future.
