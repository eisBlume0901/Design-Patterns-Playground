You are designing a system for a pizza delivery service.
The service offers different types of pizzas like Margherita, Pepperoni, and Veggie.
Each type of pizza can have extra toppings like extra cheese, olives, chicken, and mushrooms.
The cost of each pizza varies and each extra topping also has an additional cost.
