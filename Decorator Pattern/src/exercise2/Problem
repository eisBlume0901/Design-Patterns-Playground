You are developing a game where players can customize their characters.
The base character has some basic attributes like health, strength, and speed.
Players can add enhancements to their characters which modify these attributes.
The enhancements available are:

1. Armor: Increases health by 50.
2. Sword: Increases strength by 30.
3. Boots: Increases speed by 10.

Each character can have multiple enhancements, and the same enhancement can be added multiple times.
For example, a character with two armors will have their health increased by 100.

Design a system using the decorator pattern that will allow players to add enhancements to their characters
and calculate the resulting attributes.

Constraints:

- Use the Decorator Pattern to solve this problem.
- Each enhancement should be a separate class.
