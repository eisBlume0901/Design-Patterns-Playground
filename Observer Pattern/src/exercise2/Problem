Problem: Stock Market Monitoring

You are tasked with building a stock market monitoring system.
The system should allow multiple investors to track the price changes of different stocks.
When the price of a stock changes, all the investors interested in that stock should be
notified with the updated price.

Requirements:

Create a Stock class that represents a stock with a unique symbol (e.g., AAPL for Apple Inc.) and a current price.
Create an Investor class that represents an investor interested in one or more stocks.
Implement the Observer Pattern, where Investor objects subscribe to receive price updates for specific stocks.
When the price of a stock changes, notify all subscribed investors with the updated price.
Allow investors to subscribe and unsubscribe from stocks of interest.
Implement a method to change the price of a stock, triggering notifications to subscribed investors.
Ensure that investors receive notifications only for the stocks they are interested in.
