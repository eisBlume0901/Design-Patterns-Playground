Problem: News Notification System

You are tasked with building a news notification system.
The system consists of a publisher (the news agency) and
multiple subscribers (news readers). When the news agency
publishes a new article, it should notify all subscribed
news readers so they can receive and read the article.

Requirements:

Create a NewsAgency class that acts as the publisher.
Create a NewsReader class that acts as the subscriber.
Implement an Observer Pattern where NewsReader objects subscribe to the
NewsAgency to receive notifications.
When a new article is published by the NewsAgency, all subscribed NewsReader
objects should be notified and display the article title.
Ensure that new NewsReader objects can subscribe and existing ones can unsubscribe
from the NewsAgency.
