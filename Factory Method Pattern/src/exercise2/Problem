    A company called "TechGuru" is developing an application to manage different types of Course programs. 
    They have various Course programs such as "Java Programming," "Web Development," and "Data Science." 
    Each Course program has its own content and materials.
    
    Implement the Factory Method Design Pattern to create a CourseProgram interface and concrete classes 
    for each type of Course program. The company wants the flexibility to add new Course programs without 
    modifying the existing code.
    
    Requirements:
    Create a CourseProgram interface with a method getCourseContent() to retrieve the content of the Course program.
    
    Implement concrete classes JavaProgramming, WebDevelopment, and DataScience that implement the CourseProgram interface.
    
    Implement a CourseProgramFactory interface with a method createCourseProgram() that returns an instance of a specific 
    Course program.
    
    Create concrete factories JavaProgrammingFactory, WebDevelopmentFactory, and DataScienceFactory that implement the CourseProgramFactory 
    interface.
    
    In the application, allow the user to choose a Course program, and then use the corresponding factory to create an instance 
    of that Course program and display its content.
